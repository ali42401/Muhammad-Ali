      <h1 id="Eagles">Eagles </h1>
      <p>Eagles are among the most revered birds of prey, known for their exceptional hunting skills, keen eyesight, and majestic presence. Belonging to the family Accipitridae, which includes hawks, kites, and vultures, eagles are found in various habitats around the world, from the rugged mountains and vast forests to open plains and coastal regions. Their significance in ecosystems and cultures has made them symbols of power and freedom.</p>
      <p>Physical Characteristics
        Eagles are characterized by their large size, strong beaks, and powerful talons. There are over 60 species of eagles, with sizes varying considerably. The golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), one of the most widely distributed species, has a wingspan of up to 7 feet (2.1 meters) and can weigh between 3 to 6.5 kg (6.5 to 14.3 lbs). The larger species, such as the African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), are known for their striking plumage, which often features a combination of white, brown, and golden feathers.
        
        One of the most remarkable attributes of eagles is their eyesight. Eagles possess vision that is four to eight times stronger than that of humans, allowing them to spot prey from great distances. Their eyes are specially adapted to detect motion and discern fine details, making them highly effective hunters.</p>
        <img src="../zoo/zoo gallery/Eagles, 2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500">
        <p>Eagles are apex predators, primarily feeding on a diet of fish, small mammals, and birds. Their hunting techniques vary by species and habitat. For instance, the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), native to North America, is known for its fishing prowess. It swoops down to catch fish with its powerful talons, often snatching prey just beneath the water's surface. Other species, like the steppe eagle (Aquila nipalensis), may hunt small mammals and birds on the ground.

            Eagles are also known for their impressive aerial displays during hunting, soaring high above the landscape to scan for movement. Once they spot potential prey, they dive with remarkable speed and precision. This hunting efficiency makes eagles vital for maintaining the balance of their ecosystems, as they help control prey populations.</p>
            <p>Eagles typically build large nests, often in tall trees or on cliff edges, using sticks and other materials. These nests can be reused and expanded upon year after year, resulting in massive structures that can reach several feet in diameter.

                Most eagles mate for life, returning to the same nesting site each breeding season. Females usually lay one to three eggs, which both parents incubate. After about 35 days, the eggs hatch, and the parents work together to feed and protect their chicks. The young eagles fledge after several weeks but may remain dependent on their parents for food and support for months afterward.</p>

                <img src="../zoo/zoo gallery/Sparrows, 2.jpg" alt=""  width="500" height="500">
                <p>Sparrows are among the most ubiquitous and recognizable birds worldwide. Belonging to the family Passeridae, these small, agile birds are commonly found in a variety of habitats, including urban areas, gardens, and rural landscapes. Despite their commonality, sparrows possess fascinating characteristics and behaviors that contribute to their ecological significance and cultural impact.

                    Physical Characteristics
                    Sparrows are small birds, typically measuring about 4.5 to 7 inches in length, with a stout body, short tail, and conical bill that is well-suited for their seed-based diet. Most species exhibit a mix of brown, gray, and white plumage, which provides effective camouflage against predators. The house sparrow (Passer domesticus), one of the most familiar species, is characterized by its short, thick neck and a distinctive black patch on its throat.
                    
                    While sparrows are often seen as inconspicuous due to their muted colors, their lively behaviors and social interactions make them quite engaging to observe. They often move in flocks, chirping and chattering as they forage for food, and their lively antics bring vibrancy to their environments.</p>
                    <p>Sparrows are primarily granivorous, meaning their diet consists mainly of seeds. However, they are also opportunistic feeders, consuming insects, fruits, and scraps from human activities. Their foraging behavior often involves hopping on the ground or fluttering between bushes and trees in search of food. House sparrows, for instance, have adapted remarkably well to urban environments, where they scavenge leftovers from parks and streets.

                        Their ability to thrive in various habitats is partly due to their adaptability in finding food sources. During the breeding season, adult sparrows often feed their chicks a diet rich in protein, including insects and other invertebrates, which are crucial for the growth and development of the young birds.</p>
                        <p>Sparrows are known for their remarkable nesting behaviors. They typically build their nests in sheltered locations, such as trees, shrubs, and even human-made structures like eaves and vents. Their nests are made from grass, twigs, feathers, and other materials, and are often lined with softer substances for insulation and comfort.

                            The female sparrow usually lays between three to six eggs, which are incubated for about 10 to 14 days. Both parents are involved in caring for the young, feeding them a diet that consists primarily of seeds and insects. Once the chicks fledge, they remain dependent on their parents for food and protection for a few weeks, during which they learn to navigate their surroundings.
                            
                            Cultural Significance
                            Throughout history, sparrows have held various meanings in different cultures. In literature and folklore, they are often seen as symbols of joy, freedom, and the simplicity of life. For example, in many traditions, sparrows are associated with good fortune and are celebrated for their resilience and adaptability.
                            
                            In addition to their cultural significance, sparrows play vital roles in ecosystems. As seed dispersers, they contribute to the growth of plants and help maintain the balance of their habitats. Their presence in gardens and urban areas can also indicate environmental health.
                            
                            Conservation Status
